I will be able to be nice, even when I*#10*m in a mood
I will be trying my best to get on with people all the time
I will be more confident
When I am finding it hard and I feel there is a chance I will lose it, I will be able to ask someone for help to talk things through.</node>

        <node>For my first time doing my target I think that I am a 5. I know I am a five and not a 6 because if I was a 6 I would be able to get on with people in my groups in class. Instead I just get into arguments. I don*#10*t get into arguments much in English. I am in a good group there, they are nice to me and understand sometimes when I get angry and they just leave me alone to calm down.

When I*#10*m finished working through this with my worker, I would like to be an 8. An 8 for me would be...

I would still be able to be nice, even when I*#10*m in a mood
I would be trying my best to get on with people all the time
I would be more confident

        <node>This week has been really hard for me, and I don*#10*t feel that things are getting better. I am finding it harder, I want to be a 4. Everyone seems to be getting at me, even the people in my English class. I thought they were on my side. They have been really horrible to me this week.

I want to stop going to school, but I am still managing in every morning, and I*#10*m still trying my best, but a few times this week I have just snapped. I got angry.

I did manage not to get angry this week, once,  because I was able to say to Mr Bale that I was finding things difficult. Mr Bale really helped, and I was able to calm down once I talked things through and understood what was going on. I had jumped to a wrong conclusion, I had n*#10*t really understood what a boy was saying to me. I thought he was taking the mick, but he was n*#10*t.

For next week I*#10*m going to try to get back up to a five. If I was a five I would be able to be friends again in English.</node>
