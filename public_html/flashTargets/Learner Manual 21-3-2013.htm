<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>flashTargets Learner is a
software application that provides a framework for a series of learning
conversations. The software is intended to be used as part of a solution oriented
approach with two modalities included in this version, a 0-10 target tool, and
a learning stances tool. For each learning conversation there is intended to be
an accompanying narrative which is recorded as a text input.</p>

<h1 style='text-align:justify'>Application Controls</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=554
height=407 src="Learner%20Manual%2021-3-2013_files/image001.gif"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There are five main tools in
flashTargets learner: the chart; narrative; stance; file; and the target.</p>

<h2 style='text-align:justify'>Chart</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The chart displays all conversations
for a learner’s target, and is intended to be the main control in this application.
The horizontal axis is the chronological order and the vertical axis is the
learners “target tool” assessment of their progress. Each conversation in the
chart is displayed using a radar component, and are connected through a line
graph. The chart also has a text area above the chart to type in the target
text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>To edit or view a conversation on
the chart, select the radar. Once a radar is selected, a number of things
happen: the date that the conversation was recorded is displayed immediately to
the right; the narrative tool creates a tab for the narrative (with the same
date displayed for that conversation in a tab); and the stances tool display
the stances taken for that conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>If only one conversation is
selected in the chart tool, a component to edit the target value is visible on
the left hand side, to increase the target tool value click on the “up” arrow,
to decrease click “down”. To completely remove a conversation, use the
scissors. If more than one conversation is selected these components are no
longer visible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=516
height=330 src="Learner%20Manual%2021-3-2013_files/image002.gif"></p>

<h2>Narrative</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The narrative (a fuzzy purple
rectangle) works like a tabbed browser. When a conversation is selected at the
chart, a tab is created. When a conversation is deselected the tab is destroyed
(any edited changes will persist). The current conversation is listed as the
“now” tab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When a tab is selected in the Narrative
tool, the Stances tool displays any learning stances input for that
conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Narrative has a spellchecker
called “squiggly”, and makes use of an American spelling dictionary. “Squiggly”
works like most spellcheckers, underwriting a red squiggly line when a spelling
error is present, and a right click to get correction suggestions in the
context menu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=516
height=327 src="Learner%20Manual%2021-3-2013_files/image003.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Stance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><img width=289 height=175
src="Learner%20Manual%2021-3-2013_files/image004.gif" align=right hspace=12>The
stance is a tool that facilitates the inclusion of motivational approaches
within learning conversations. The stance tool is controlled by a set of radars
that can be selected to indicate a learning stance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This could be the stance the
learner has assessed as part of their conversation, or perhaps the stances the
teacher has assessed as part of their feedback when delivering a next steps
pathway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When the Narrative has tabs
visible, the Stances tool will always display the learning stances for the
selected tab at the Narrative.</p>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The target is the second scaling
tool. If the target is not set, any changes made to previous learning
conversations will be saved, but setting this control is necessary if the <img
width=259 height=245 src="Learner%20Manual%2021-3-2013_files/image005.gif"
align=right hspace=12>current conversation is to be saved. If a save is
attempted without the target tool set, an alert dialogue will tell you…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i> &quot;No value has been
provided so this conversation will not be added to the file (any changes made
to the target, previous conversations, or learner name will be saved).&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The target works in the same way
as a shooting target, where a mouse click at the outside ring is “0” and at the
centre is a “10”, with values incrementing in 1’s. A 0.1 increment is available
by pressing “Ctrl” and then using the up or down arrows on the keyboard.</p>

<h2><img width=149 height=214
src="Learner%20Manual%2021-3-2013_files/image006.jpg" align=right hspace=12>File</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The file tool allows (with a
double click) files to get opened, saved, and PDF generation. A PDF file can be
generated to include all conversations, or just conversations selected in the
chart. This is done using the radar immediately to the right of the PDF icon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At the base of this component is
a text input for the learners name to be recorded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At the top of the file tool there
is a confidentiality radar component that allows learners the choice to include
the narrative of the current conversation within the PDF, or to keep this
narrative confidential, in which case the PDF will substitute the narrative for
the text… “This conversation has not been shared”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There is the facility to create
two circles of confidentiality within flashTargets by distributing only PDF’s
to an outer circle, and inner circle access using the “.ltf” files in
conjunction with the flashTargets application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>If you want to take advantage of
this feature, the learner should be asked at the end of every conversation if
they would like to share their conversation. If they chose to share, this is
recorded on the conversation using the confidentiality radar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Starting a flashTargets File for the First Time</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When the application start’s up,
there will be “Input Target” and “Input Name” fading in and out of view. These
are there to let you know where to type in the learners target and the learner
name. You will only have to do this once for each flashTargets record, and it
remains editable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At this point we can save ready
for the first conversation with the learner, again, we will be warned in an
alert dialogue that…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i>&quot;No value has been
provided so this conversation will not be added to the file (any changes made
to the target, previous conversations, or learner name will be saved).&quot;</i></p>

<h1>flashTargets files</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>flashTargets files are in a XML
format and in an emergency can be opened / repaired / modified by standard XML
editors like Microsoft’s free “XML Notepad 2007” or a text editor. The file
extension is “.ltf” (learner target file).</p>
