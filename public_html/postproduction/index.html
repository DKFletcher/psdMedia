   <p>Hello, and welcome to whatMotivatesLearning.com</p>

<p>'What motivates learning?' is a question that has as many answers as there are people and situations. We think that our six freely available tools provide a powerful and intuitive platform for each learner, teacher, or parent to exchange and learn each other's view. The software is intended to bring into focus the processes; interactions and assumptions of learning. It is our hope that this site will help you to form, share or apply this view, your answer to one of the most fundamental questions concerning education and society, what motivates learning?</p>
<p>There is other online content that you may want to buy (the assembly, zero, and  share) and these can be viewed in more detail from the resources page. Please feel free to email us at sales@whatMotivatesLearning.com to enquire further. Similarly, Alan McLean has written some wonderful books that accompany the content, and if you want to further develop your skills using these tools, or understand their evolution then reading his books are a must.</p>
<p>whatMotivatesLearning.com does not use databases. The only record of your work will be the records you keep and share. This involves you, the user, having the responsibilty of saving or disposing of your own work securely.</p>
